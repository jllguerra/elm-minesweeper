# Minesweeper in Elm

This is my attempt at implementing the Minesweeper game in Elm.

## Prerequisites

* [elm 0.16](http://elm-lang.org/install)
* [entr](https://bitbucket.org/eradman/entr/) - only if you want to automatically
rebuild the app when a .elm file changes.

## Building
```
$ elm package install
$ ./build
```

To rebuild app on file changes...still a bit of a work in progress.
```
$ ./rebuildOnSrcChange
```

## Publishing to GitHub pages

`./publish`

## Running in browser locally

`open index.html`

## Running application
